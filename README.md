Apple Media Explorer is an Apple Music UI inspired iTunes media finder built using Typescript, React, React Context API, and Apple's iTunes Search API. Made with love by **Mitchell Hollander**.

## Features
User's are able to search through the entire catalog of iTunes to view media details and download cover artwork.

## TODOS/Fixes
- make selecting genre buttons work and filter data per genre chosen
- make animations smoother
- add error handlers and loaders for api calls
- add more intractable elements (such as the progress ring component I already have ready)
- add better and more explicit types for typescript

## Future Goals
- implement "Sign in with Apple" and add user login/sign-up functionality
- implement Apple MusicKit API for Music explorer section 
- find a way to get live data from iTunes API (ex: Recently Added, New Releases, etc...)
- figure out how to get new 16:9 ratio cover artwork images from Apple API or other source
